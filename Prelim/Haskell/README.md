## Functional Programming (Haskell)
### Environment

[GHCi](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/#platform)

### Recommended VSCode Extension
#### [Simple GHC (Haskell) Integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dramforever.vscode-ghc-simple)
Code Highlighting. Syntax Checking. Documentation of functions. Checking Type of a expression.

Most useful and easy-to-use Haskell extension as it does not require installing any other software and works for single file (which covers all usage in first year)

#### [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)

Run code (using ghci).

### Unrecommended VSCode Extension
#### [Haskell GHCi Debug Adapter Phoityne](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=phoityne.phoityne-vscode)
The tool this extension requires is a little bit hard to install. In most cases in first year, you can find bugs in your code by running a few examples.
