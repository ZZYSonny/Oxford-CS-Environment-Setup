This repo includes instructions to set up environment and recommended VSCode extensions for courses I took in Oxford. 

While most instructions provided in courses use pure command line, I think it is helpful to use tools and this might help you finish practicals and sheets more quickly. Most of these setup includes (realtime) Syntax Checking and Some of them includes line by line debug.

Please browse through the folder to find a setup for a course.

Any contribution is welcomed.
